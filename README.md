Pyth Helm charts

## pre-commit hooks
pre-commit is a tool that checks and fixes simple issues (formatting, ...) before each commit.
You can install it by following [their website](https://pre-commit.com/). In order to enable checks
for this repo run `pre-commit install` from command-line in the root of this repo.

The checks are also performed in the CI to ensure the code follows consistent formatting.

In this repo the chart READMEs are autogenerated from the chart metadata using
[helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) and pre-commit hook is used to
keep them up-to-date. You need to have helm-docs installed for the hook to work.
